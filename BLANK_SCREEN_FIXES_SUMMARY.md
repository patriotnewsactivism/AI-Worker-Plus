# Blank Screen Issue Fixes Summary

## Problem
The AI Worker Plus application was displaying a blank screen instead of rendering the UI. This was preventing users from accessing any of the application's features.

## Root Causes Identified
1. **JSX Syntax Errors**: The App.jsx file was using HTML entities (`&lt;`, `&gt;`) instead of proper JSX syntax (`<`, `>`)
2. **CSS Class Mismatch**: The JSX was using `.app` as the main container class, but the CSS file was defining styles for `.app-container`
3. **JavaScript Initialization Order**: The `agentManager` was being initialized before the `apiKey` state was defined, causing JavaScript errors
4. **Function Reference Issues**: Some functions were being referenced in the JSX before they were defined

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Corrected JSX Syntax
- Replaced all HTML entities with proper JSX syntax
- Fixed the return statement to use valid JSX elements

### 2. Fixed CSS Class Mismatch
- Updated the CSS file to use `.app` instead of `.app-container`
- Ensured all CSS styles are properly applied to the JSX elements

### 3. Fixed JavaScript Initialization Order
- Moved the `agentManager` initialization to occur after the `apiKey` state definition
- Ensured all dependencies are properly initialized before use

### 4. Verified Function Definitions
- Confirmed all functions referenced in the JSX are properly defined before use
- Maintained proper component structure and event handling

## Results
- Application now builds successfully without errors

  - 7 specialized AI templates
  - Long-running task system

## Testing
