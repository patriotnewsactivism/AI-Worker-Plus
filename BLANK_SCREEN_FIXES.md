# Blank Screen Issue Fixes

## Issues Identified
1. **Missing Functions**: Several functions referenced in the JSX were not defined:
   - `handleFileProcessed` - used in FileUpload component
   - `handleGitHubConnect` - used in FileUpload component
   - `handleVoiceCommand` - referenced in Developer template example

2. **Incorrect AgentManager Usage**: 
   - Imported as a component but used as a hook
   - The AgentManager.jsx was designed to return an object but was being used as a React component

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Added Missing Functions
Added the following functions to App.jsx:
- `handleFileProcessed` - Processes uploaded files and adds them to workspace
- `handleGitHubConnect` - Simulates GitHub connection
- `handleVoiceCommand` - Handles voice command activation
- `handleAgentResults` - Processes results from multi-agent system

### 2. Fixed AgentManager Implementation
- Converted AgentManager.jsx from a component that returns an object to a proper React hook (`useAgentManager`)
- Updated import statement in App.jsx to use the hook correctly
- Properly integrated the hook into the App component

### 3. React Version Compatibility
- Downgraded from React 19 (beta) to React 18.2.0 for better stability
- Updated corresponding type definitions

## Verification
- ✅ Application builds successfully without errors
- ✅ Development server starts without issues
- ✅ All required functions are now properly defined
- ✅ AgentManager hook works correctly
- ✅ No JavaScript errors in browser console

## Testing
The application is now accessible at: https://5179-d6a430de-7dbc-44db-8d99-b39bb5dddb97.proxy.daytona.works

Users should now see the complete AI Worker Plus interface instead of a blank screen.

## Additional Improvements
- Maintained all existing functionality including:
  - Voice-activated AI assistant
  - File handling with ZIP extraction
  - Multi-agent system
  - GitHub integration framework
  - PWA capabilities
- Ensured backward compatibility with all existing features

These fixes resolve the blank screen issue by addressing the root causes: undefined functions causing JavaScript errors and incorrect usage of the AgentManager component.
