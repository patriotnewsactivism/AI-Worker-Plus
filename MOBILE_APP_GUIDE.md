# AI Worker Plus - Mobile App Installation Guide

## 📱 Install as a Mobile App (Progressive Web App - PWA)

### What is a PWA?
A Progressive Web App (PWA) is a web application that can be installed on your mobile device just like a native app. It works offline, has its own icon on your home screen, and provides a native-like experience.

### Installation Instructions

#### 🤖 Android (Chrome/Edge/Firefox)
1. **Open AI Worker Plus** in your mobile browser
2. **Tap the menu** (three dots) in the top-right corner
3. **Select "Install app"** or "Add to Home screen"
4. **Confirm installation** by tapping "Install"
5. **Launch the app** from your home screen!

#### 🍎 iOS (Safari)
1. **Open AI Worker Plus** in Safari browser
2. **Tap the Share button** (square with arrow) at the bottom
3. **Scroll down** and tap "Add to Home Screen"
4. **Customize the name** (optional) and tap "Add"
5. **Find the app** on your home screen!

### Benefits of Installing as PWA
- ✅ **Offline Access** - Works without internet connection
- ✅ **Faster Loading** - Instant startup from home screen
- ✅ **No App Store** - Direct installation, no approval needed
- ✅ **Auto-Updates** - Always latest version
- ✅ **Native Feel** - Full-screen experience
- ✅ **Push Notifications** - Get alerts for important updates

## 🎯 Alternative: Native App Store Distribution

### For True Native Apps (If Needed)

While PWA is recommended for its simplicity and cost-effectiveness, you can also create native apps for app stores:

#### Option 1: Capacitor Framework
```bash
# Install Capacitor
npm install @capacitor/core @capacitor/cli
npm install @capacitor/android @capacitor/ios

# Initialize
npx cap init "AI Worker Plus" "com.aiworker.app"

# Add platforms
npx cap add android
npx cap add ios

# Build and sync
npm run build
npx cap sync
```

#### Option 2: App Store Publishing Costs
- **Google Play Store**: $25 one-time fee
- **Apple App Store**: $99/year developer fee
- **Total**: ~$124/year for full distribution

#### Option 3: Alternative Stores
- **Amazon Appstore**: Free for Android
- **F-Droid**: Free (open source)
- **Direct APK**: Free distribution
